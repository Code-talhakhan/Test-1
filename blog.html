    <h2 id="post-1"><i><u>Financial literacy matters:</u></i></h2>
    <p>Financial literacy is one of the most important skills everyone should learn. It helps individuals understand how to manage money, savings, debt, and investments. People who are financially literate make better decisions when it comes to budgeting, credit cards, and loans. For example, knowing the difference between good debt (like education loans) and bad debt (like high-interest credit cards) can save thousands of dollars. Schools and universities should also focus on teaching financial literacy, as it builds a foundation for a stable financial future.</p><hr>

    <h2 id="post-3"><i><u>Saving vs. investing:</u></i></h2>
    <p>While saving money is important, it is not enough to build long-term wealth. Due to inflation, the value of money decreases over time. This means keeping cash in a bank account may not be the best option. Investing in assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, or mutual funds can help your money grow faster than inflation. For example, investing $100 every month in a stock market fund can grow into thousands of dollars over time. Therefore, investing is a powerful tool for financial growth.</p><hr>
    <h2 id="post-4"><i><u>The psycology of spending:</u></i></h2>
    <p>Many people struggle with overspending, not because they don’t earn enough, but because they cannot control their buying habits. Marketing tricks, social media trends, and peer pressure push us to buy unnecessary products. This is known as “emotional spending.” To avoid this, financial experts recommend following the 24-hour rule — before buying something expensive, wait one day to decide if you really need it. Understanding the psychology of spending can help people save more and live stress-free.</p><hr>
    <h2 id="post-5"><i><u>Building wealth early:</u></i></h2>
    <p>Building wealth is not about earning a high salary, but about developing smart money habits early. People in their 20s and 30s should focus on saving, avoiding debt, and investing in their skills. One of the best strategies is to follow the 50/30/20 rule: spend 50% of income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings/investments. Additionally, starting a side hustle, learning about the stock market, and building passive income sources can help secure financial freedom at an early age.</p><hr>
